## 🎯 Overview

### Problem Statement

Hospitals face critical challenges in predicting and managing patient billing costs, 
resulting in significant financial and operational inefficiencies:

**Financial Impact:**
- Unpredictable revenue streams complicate budgeting and cash flow management
- High-cost patients (top 10%) account for 60% of total billing but cannot be 
  identified early for intervention
- Billing disputes and delayed payments due to unexpected costs

**Operational Impact:**
- Inability to forecast resource needs during peak periods (e.g., flu season)
- Reactive staffing leads to either overcapacity waste or understaffing burnout
- No systematic approach to identifying cost drivers

**Patient Impact:**
- 78% of patients report surprise medical bills
- Lack of upfront cost transparency reduces satisfaction and payment compliance
- Financial stress affects health outcomes and recovery

Current billing estimation methods rely on broad averages and fail to account for 
individual patient factors like age, medical condition, admission type, and length 
of stay. This results in **$2-3M in preventable costs annually** for medium-sized 
hospitals and poor patient experiences.
